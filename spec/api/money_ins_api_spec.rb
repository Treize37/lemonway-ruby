## Introduction    This service provides methods for automating the management of the accounts and operations.    __A strict control access on the IP is applied, make sure you have the rights before requesting the API.__    Please note that this version of the API is in pilot stage, and therefore may evolve in the future. Should you be interested in integrating this version, please contact your Lemon Way account manager or <a href=\"https://support.lemonway.com/hc/requests/new\" target=\"_blank\">the support team</a>.    # Authentication    The authentication service strictly follow the __chapter 4.4.2__ [Access Token request](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.4.2) of the __RFC 6749__.    The unique method exposed by the api provides a unique bearer access associate a unique directkit. All dikectkit and environment have their own access.    The bearer allow an application to consume the api Rest Directkit    __This response has these scenarios:__  * In case the bearer do not exist, the method create a new bearer.  * In case the bearer already exist, it return the actual bearer with the remaining time left.  * In case the bearer lifetime is over, a new one is created, the old one is permanently deleted.  * In case of failure, a http statut code error with succinct information for security purpose.    # oauth2    __cURL example__:    ```  curl -X POST \"https://authentication.lemonway.com/v1/token\"      -H \"accept: application/json;charset=UTF-8\"      -H \"Authorization: Basic 375d7fd6-f1c3-41ed-82c6-c273fe384318\"      -H \"Content_Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\"      -d \"grant_type=client_credentials\"  ```    The OAuth2 documentation is available at this link [OAuth2 authentication](https://172.31.0.84:8082/oauth2-public/token/swagger).    Once you call the method, and if the informations provided are corrects, you will get a response with a bearer.    Use the provided bearer to request the directkit service    __Response example__:  ```  {      \"access_token\": \"4442659a-bebc-4afb-8fbd-21d19ae11972\", // unique bearer access      \"token_type\": \"Bearer\",      \"expires_in\": 3600 // secondes  }  ```    ___Note: Use the same method to renew your bearer once it got expired___    # Notifications    The __WHITE BRAND__ may want to receive notifications when __certain events are triggered__ (e.g. on payment account status change, on documentation status change...).  These notifications can be received by e-mail (HTML format) or be sent to an information system (webhooks / callbacks through HTTP POST or GET). For more information about notifications, please visit [the notifications documentation](https://documentation.lemonway.com/en/notifications).  To activate notifications, please log on the __WHITE BRAND back-office__ and go to the \"__Configuration/Notifications__\" menu.

You will redirect your client to the payment page&lt;br /&gt;  In most case, you will have to combine the Token and the WEBKIT URL to get the payment page URL&lt;br /&gt;  For example: https://sandbox-webkit.lemonway.fr/YOUR_COMPANY/dev/?moneyintoken&#x3D;1wGaBwkdOmOxWT0s4t1Z1364815  You should find the URL of the WEBKIT in the onboarding email.
