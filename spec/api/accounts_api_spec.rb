The unique method exposed by the api provides a unique bearer access associate a unique directkit. All dikectkit and environment have their own access.    The bearer allow an application to consume the api Rest Directkit    __This response has these scenarios:__  * In case the bearer do not exist, the method create a new bearer.  * In case the bearer already exist, it return the actual bearer with the remaining time left.  * In case the bearer lifetime is over, a new one is created, the old one is permanently deleted.  * In case of failure, a http statut code error with succinct information for security purpose.    # oauth2    __cURL example__:    ```  curl -X POST \"https://authentication.lemonway.com/v1/token\"      -H \"accept: application/json;charset=UTF-8\"      -H \"Authorization: Basic 375d7fd6-f1c3-41ed-82c6-c273fe384318\"      -H \"Content_Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\"      -d \"grant_type=client_credentials\"  ```    The OAuth2 documentation is available at this link [OAuth2 authentication](https://172.31.0.84:8082/oauth2-public/token/swagger).    Once you call the method, and if the informations provided are corrects, you will get a response with a bearer.    Use the provided bearer to request the directkit service    __Response example__:  ```  {      \"access_token\": \"4442659a-bebc-4afb-8fbd-21d19ae11972\", // unique bearer access      \"token_type\": \"Bearer\",      \"expires_in\": 3600 // secondes  }  ```    ___Note: Use the same method to renew your bearer once it got expired___    # Notifications    The __WHITE BRAND__ may want to receive notifications when __certain events are triggered__ (e.g. on payment account status change, on documentation status change...).  These notifications can be received by e-mail (HTML format) or be sent to an information system (webhooks / callbacks through HTTP POST or GET).
